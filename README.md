# Mapty Project

Web application that allows users to keep track of their workout logs.

# Motivation

I worked on this project when I took a Javascript course on Udemy taught by instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. Since I found this project interesting, so I kept working on it and added more features including edditing, deleting and sorting the workout logs.
